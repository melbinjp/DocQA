This project is about building a new, modern frontend for the DocQA application. The frontend will be built using React and will be designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and internationalized.

## Architecture

The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It will use `axios` for API communication, `react-router-dom` for routing, and `i18next` for internationalization. The application will be structured with a clear separation of concerns, with components, services, and contexts organized into separate directories.
