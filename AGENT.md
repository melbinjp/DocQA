This project is about building a new, modern frontend for the DocQA application. The frontend will be built using React and will be designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and internationalized.

## Architecture

The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It will use `axios` for API communication, `react-router-dom` for routing, and `i18next` for internationalization. The application will be structured with a clear separation of concerns, with components, services, and contexts organized into separate directories.

## Plan

A detailed, step-by-step plan for this project can be found in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

The high-level plan is as follows:

1.  **Set up the React development environment.**
2.  **Implement the core application structure and layout.**
3.  **Implement API connection and session management.**
4.  **Build the document upload, query, and document list components.**
5.  **Implement internationalization and refine the UI.**
6.  **Verify, document, and submit the foundational skeleton.**
